# Weather Data Retrieval Application

Welcome to the **Big Data December Challenge**! This repository contains a project developed as part of the challenge to build and refine data engineering skills. üöÄ‚ùÑÔ∏è

## Project Overview

This application is designed to fetch weather data from an external API and store it on disk for further analysis. It focuses on building foundational skills in data extraction (ETL pipelines) and handling raw data, with an emphasis on reusability and scalability.

## Features

- **Fetch Weather Data**: Retrieves weather data for specified cities and dates.
- **Parameterization**: Flexible configuration to fetch data for various cities or time periods.
- **Historical Data Support**: Potential to extend functionality to include past weather data.
- **Storage Options**: Save retrieved data locally or optionally to cloud-based storage solutions like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or HDFS.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Requests (or equivalent for HTTP interactions)
- **Version Control**: Git

## Learning Objectives

- Familiarization with weather APIs and external data sources.
- Building foundational skills for ETL pipelines (Extract phase).
- Practicing data engineering workflows for real-world applications.
- Developing reusable, parameterized scripts to streamline data retrieval.
